Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) Smoke Tests
==============================
Smoke-testing of Internet-in-a-Box OS builds using Jekins and vagrant. This repository contains Vagrant virtual images for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and CentOS. Unfortunately Rasbian virtual image is not currently available for Vagrant.

The goal of the project is to port [George Hunt's xsce-tests](https://github.com/georgejhunt/xsce-tests/) for Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) project.

# Usage
You'll need a [Jenkins server](http://jenkins.io/) with [Vagrant plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Vagrant-plugin) installed. You can then add new jobs to build Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) for each target operating system.
